        <h1>Handicap Calculator</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I developed the Handicap Calculator for Stone Ridge Golf Course, Elliot Lake in Summer 2024. 
            I met with clients to discuss requirements in early January. They wanted a system that could 
            accurately estimate a golfer's handicap, while being less expensive than the world handicap 
            system. In order to do so, they wanted a record of all a golfer's past games, which golfers 
            can easily view through the program. It was also very important for them to be able to export 
            the program's data as an excel sheet.

        <p>
            The clients wanted an efficient way to copy and paste all their data from an existing spreadsheet,
            and allow an administrator of average technical profficiency to easily manipulate it. Even though 
            it was not the most efficient way to store data for the program, storing the data in an Excel sheet 
            met the client's requirements. Thus, I used Apache POI to programmatically read and write an xlsx 
            file.

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
